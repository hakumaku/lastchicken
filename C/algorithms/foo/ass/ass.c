/*
 * A* Search(A star search)
 *
 * One of informed search algorithms that it solves
 * problems by searching among all possible paths to the solution for
 * the one that incurs the smallest cost.
 * f(n) = g(n) + h(n) where n is the last node on the path,
 * g(n) is the cost of the path from the start node to n,
 * and h(n) is a heuristic that estimates the cost of the cheapest
 * path from n to the goal.
